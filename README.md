# LOL Chat Client

The frontend to a simple chatroom app in ReactJS that matches the provided figma design.  

It should give you a box to type chat messages into (with a send button), 
and show a log of past chat messages you've sent. 
It should allow you to choose a status using the dropdown.
There's no backend required in this, 
you'll just be using local state to pretend that there's 
a real backend that messages are submitted to. 
The only messages appearing in chat will be your own.
The nickname should just be hard-coded to a default.

- No API backend
- No persistent state is required
- Must be implemented as a ReactJS app
